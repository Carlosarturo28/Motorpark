## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

_I recommend to use `yarn` but you can use `npm` or whatever you want_

### `yarn`

```
yarn
```

You must run this command first to install all the needed dependencies to run the project.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the unit tests to verify everything is ok.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
