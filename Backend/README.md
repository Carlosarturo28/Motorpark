## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

_I recommend to use `yarn` but you can use `npm` or whatever you want_

###yarn

```
yarn
```

This is the first command you must run to install all the needed dependencies to run the project.

### `yarn run server`

Runs the server using `nodemon` in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

You need to run the server in order to consume the API from the frontend project.

### `yarn run test`

Launches the unit tests to verify everything is ok.<br />
